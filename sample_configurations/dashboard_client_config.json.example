// Example file to configure additional permanent external sites 
// Do not change this example file
// Copy the contents and edit as needed to:
// /etc/dashboard/external_sites_config.json
// and then restart the dashboard via 
//    sudo service dims-dashboard stop
//    sudo service dims-dashboard start

// Note that the dims-dashboard-deploy.yml Ansible playbook will also deploy this file
// if you give the playbook the location of the file on your workstation (see the 
// dims-dashboard-deploy.yml file for information)

// Add or remove external sites as you see fit.
// Note that the first two sites are special - the build of the dashboard will
// populate the "siteURL" property for each. The urls for consul and trident are
// particular to your system and are included in the dashboard.conf file 
// /etc/dashboard/dashboard.conf.

// If you don't want your users to access consul, remove that entry from the
// siteExternals property. However, you should not remove the Trident entry, or your
// users will not be able to access it from the dashboard.

// If you are using a different logo than the default ('UW-logo.png'), specify the
// name of the logo in "siteLogo". The logo itself should be located on the server at
// /etc/dashboard/<site-logo-name>.
